    <h2>BOOMING CAT STUDIOS</h2>
    <p>my friend here, who goes by booming cat studios on youtube, helped a bit by giving me resources and other stuff when i first started learning html. thanks!</p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BoomingCatStudios/videos">check out his youtube channel!</a> <p>(don't click if you're in the youtube boycott)</p>
    <p>he mostly does some "low quality animations" as he puts it, but his support was very nice to have in the early stages of my html journey!</p>
